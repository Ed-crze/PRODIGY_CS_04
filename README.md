A Simple Keylogger program
Create a basic keylogger program that records and logs keystrokes. Focus on logging the keys pressed and saving them to a file. (Note: Ethical considerations and permissions are crucial for projects involving keyloggers.)
This project captures and logs keystrokes using the keyboard library in Python. Each key press is recorded and appended to a file named keystrokes.txt.


This program first defines the on_key_press function, which is called whenever a key is pressed. 
The function writes the key name to a log file. The script then sets up a listener using the keyboard.on_press method and passes the on_key_press function as a callback. 
The keyboard.wait method keeps the program running to continuously capture keystrokes.


#ethical considerations 


Note that this program logs all keystrokes, including special keys like Ctrl, Alt, and Shift. It also logs keys that are pressed while the keylogger is running, so it may log unexpected keys if the user interacts with the console while the keylogger is running.
Creating and using keyloggers can be illegal in some jurisdictions and can be considered a violation of privacy. This code is intended for educational purposes only. Always obtain explicit permission before using a keylogger on any device.
